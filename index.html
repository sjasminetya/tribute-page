                <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of B. J. Habibie's life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1936</strong>, born in Parepare Afdeling, Dutch East Indies, 25 June 1963.</li>
                    <li><strong>1960</strong>, Habibie received an engineer's degree in Germany with the title Diplom-Ingenieur.</li>
                    <li><strong>1962</strong>, Habibie returned to Indonesia for three months on sick leave. During this time, he was reacquainted with Hasri Ainun, and the two married on 12 May 1962.</li>
                    <li><strong>1963</strong>, They had a son, Ilham Akbar Habibie</li>
                    <li><strong>1965</strong>, Habibie delivered his dissertation in aerospace engineering and received the grade of "very good", giving him the title Doktoringenieur (Dr.-Ing).
                        The same year, he accepted Hans Ebner's offer to continue his research on Thermoelastisitas and work toward his Habilitation, but he declined the offer to join RWTH as a professor. His thesis 
                        about light construction for supersonic or hypersonic states also attracted offers of employment from companies such as Boeing and Airbus, which Habibie again declined.</li>
                    <li><strong>1974</strong>, he was promoted to vice president of the company in Messerschmitt on the development of the Airbus A-300B aircraft.</li>
                    <li><strong>1974</strong>, Suharto recruited Habibie to return to Indonesia as part of his drive to industrialize and develop the country.
                        Habibie initially served as a special assistant to Ibnu Sutowo, chief executive officer of the state oil company Pertamina and Chair of Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (Indonesian: Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi, BPPT).</li>
                    <li><strong>1976</strong>, Habibie was made CEO of the new state-owned enterprise Industri Pesawat Terbang Nurtanio (IPTN; Nurtanio Aircraft Industry), which in 1985 changed its name to Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (Nusantara Aircraft Industry; also abbreviated as IPTN) and is known as Indonesian Aerospace (PT. Dirgantara Indonesia) since 2000).</li>
                    <li><strong>1978</strong>, he was appointed as State Minister of Research and Technology (Indonesian: Menteri Negara Riset dan Teknologi, Menristek). He continued to play an important role in IPTN other "strategic" industries in this post. By the 1980s, 
                        IPTN had grown considerably, specializing in the manufacture of helicopters and small passenger planes. Under Habibie's leadership, IPTN became a manufacturer of aircraft including Puma helicopters and CASA planes. It pioneered a small passenger airplane, 
                        the N-250 Gatotkaca, in 1995, but the project was a commercial failure.[16] In developing Indonesia's aviation industry, he adopted an approach called "Begin at the End and End at the Beginning".In this method, elements such as basic research became the last things upon which to focus, 
                        whilst actual manufacturing of the planes was placed as the first objective.</li>
                    <li><strong>1991</strong>, Habibie oversaw ten state-owned industries including ship- and train-building, steel, arms, communications, and energy. A 1993 estimate determined that the estimates used nearly $2 billion a year in state funding, although the government's opaque accounting practices meant that the size of the industries was not completely known.</li>
                    <li><strong>1998</strong>, In January 1998, after accepting nomination for a seventh term as President, Suharto announced the selection criteria for the nomination of a vice president. Suharto did not mention Habibie by name, but his suggestion that the next vice president should have a mastery of science and technology made it obvious he had Habibie in mind.</li>
                    <li><strong>1998</strong>, On 21 May 1998, just two months into Habibie's vice presidency, Suharto announced his resignation. Habibie, as the Constitution says, succeeded him as president. The following day, Habibie announced the Development Reform Cabinet, which removed some of the most controversial ministers in Suharto's last cabinet while maintaining 
                        others - with no major figures from the opposition. Within days of his appointment, he asked his relatives to resign from government positions, promised an early election, repealed some legislation, and ordered the release of political prisoners.</li>
                    <li><strong>1998</strong>, In late 1998, John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, sent a letter to Habibie suggesting that Indonesia defuse the East Timorese issue by providing autonomy to be followed by the promise of a referendum in the long run, following the method used by France to settle New Caledonian demands for independence. Wishing to avoid the 
                        impression that Indonesia ruled East Timor as a colony, Habibie surprised some by announcing that a referendum, offering a choice between special autonomy and independence, would be held immediately in East Timor. Leaders of the Indonesian armed forces (ABRI) were not consulted on this decision.</li>
                    <li><strong>1999</strong>, On 30 August 1999, the referendum was held and the East Timorese people overwhelmingly chose Independence. Subsequently, pro-Indonesia militias killed and displaced large numbers of people during the 1999 East Timorese crisis.[28] On 10 September, General Wiranto allegedly threatened 
                        to stage a military coup if Habibie allowed in peacekeeping forces, causing Habibie to back down. On 12 September, however, Habibie accepted a UN-mandated peacekeeping force to halt violence. A UN administration followed and East Timor became independent in 2002.</li>
                    <li><strong>2006</strong>, In September 2006, he released a book called Detik-Detik Yang Menentukan: Jalan Panjang Indonesia Menuju Demokrasi (Decisive Moments: Indonesia's Long Road Towards Democracy). The book recalled the events of May 1998 which led to his rise to the Presidency. In the book, he controversially accused Lieutenant General Prabowo Subianto, 
                        Suharto's son-in-law (at that time) and the Kostrad Commander, of planning a coup d'Ã©tat against him in May 1998.</li>
                    <li><strong>2019</strong>, In early September 2019, he was admitted to Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, where he was undergoing treatments for heart problems, namely cardiomyopathy</li>
                    <li><strong>2019</strong>, died at the age 83, on 11 September 2019.</li>
